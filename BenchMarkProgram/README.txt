COMPILEING:
	Just compile "main.cpp" don't need to include any flags or any dependencys, the other files should automaticaly be pulled with it.

RUNNING:
	Once you've compiled the program, Run the program and use "graph01.dat", "graph02.dat", and "graph03.dat" as commmand line arguments
	The program should then run using those three files as input. If you'd like to use input other than that provided, then look at the .dat files 
	for refrence and make your own and use those file names as inputs. The program MUST have three files as input otherwise it will not run. 
	Putting the same file 3 times will also work, but also kinda defetes the purpose of the progam picking one of the three......
